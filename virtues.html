	    <p>When we hear the word virtue, we might think of certain qualities such as honesty, forgiveness, and loyalty. In Western cultures, these are considered desired qualities and children are often praised for possessing these qualities and punished for not. For example, if a child is mistakenly given extra candy, she will be praised for returning the extra candy. However, in a culture where the abundance of food fluctuates, keeping the extra candy would be rational rather than dishonest, as there is no guarantee of food in the future.</p><br>
	    <p>The functions of certain “virtues” differ drastically between cultures. The Virtue Task Battery is a 5-year cross-cultural study that aims to examine the role culture plays in children’s development of virtues. Do some ecological and cultural variables promote the relatively early onset of these virtues? Does the societal value placed on these virtues predict their strength in childhood and beyond? How do these virtues co-vary as they emerge: if I am honest, am I fair? This study will provide less biased results through the inclusion of non-WEIRD (Western, educated, industrialized, rich, democratic) populations. The study will be carried out in the United States, Canada, Uganda, Ecuador, Peru and India. </p><br>

	    <div class="h-30"></div>
	    <p>The first phase of the Virtue Task Battery was carried out in the United States. The Virtue Task Battery experimental design was refined and pilot tested with participants ages 5-13 in Boston, Massachusetts. </p>
	    <div class="h-30"></div>
	    <h6> Study design </h6>
	    <p> In a task studying forgiveness, participants were told that they would get to make five rainbow scratch drawings. When the experimenter pulls out the drawing sheets, it is revealed that the sheets have already been completed. The experimenter tells the participant that they were completed by a child who was there earlier.  The experimenter also “finds a note from the child” which explains their intentions and whether or not they are remorseful. The participant then decides how many drawings they want to return to the kid that drew them and how many they want to throw away. This task has four conditions, which are manipulated via the note left from the “other kid.” </p><br>
	    <p>The four conditions are:
		    <ol type="1">
			    <li><b>intentional remorse:</b> The child knew the drawings were meant for someone else and is remorseful.</li>
			    <li><b>intentional no remorse:</b> The child knew the drawings were meant for someone else and is not remorseful</li>
			    <li><b>accidental remorse:</b> The child did not know the drawings were meant for someone else and is remorseful. </li>
			    <li><b>accidental no remorse:</b> The child did not know the drawings were meant for someone else and is not remorseful.</li>
		    </ol>
	    <br>
	    <p>Two honesty tasks were tested.</p>
		<h6>1. Marbles </h6>
		<p> In this task, children picked marbles that were either yellow or red. If the participant picked a red marble, they were rewarded with one Starburst. If they picked a yellow marble, there was no reward. Through pilot testing, we found that children were completely honest in every trial. As this pattern of honesty did not hold in the second honesty task, we believed this indicated a design flaw in the Marbles task. Therefore, our study design went through multiple iterations throughout the pilot testing period.</p>
		<u>Design 1:</u><br>
		<p>Behind a privacy box which obscured the participant from the experimenter, participants picked five marbles out of an opaque box of only yellow marbles. After picking each marble, they reported what color it was.</p>
		<u>Design 2:</u><br>
		<p>This design modification was intended to solve the issue of participants peeking into the box and discovering that all the marbles were yellow. The experimenter holds out an opaque box of only yellow marbles. The participant picks one marble at a time and looks at it behind the privacy box, and reports the color.</p>
		<u>Design 3:</u><br>
		<p>In the privacy box, the participant had an opaque box of marbles containing marbles that were each one of five different colors, but none red. They also had a clear box of multiple colored marbles, including red, which was explained to be the “trash.” The participant picked six marbles from the opaque box and put them in a tray. When they were done picking, they reported the number of red marbles and then threw all of the marbles into the trash.<br>
		   The purpose of the trash can was twofold. First, it suggested that these marbles were thrown away from previous participants, implying that multiple marble colors are present in the box. Secondly, we hoped that it would give children a greater sense of privacy. Throwing the marbles away into a pile of existing marbles would obscure which marbles were picked by the child during that trial, so that when the privacy box was removed, the experimenter seemingly would not be able to tell whether or not the child lied.</p>
		<u>Design 4:</u><br>
		<p>In the privacy box, the participant had an opaque gumball machine with all yellow marbles and 1 red marble, and a clear box of red and yellow marbles which was explained to be the “trash.” They turned the gumball machine, which was rigged to always produce a red marble on the second turn, until they had 6 marbles. The participant then threw the marbles in the trash and recorded on a piece of paper what colors they got. </p><br>
		<h6>2. Gift Box </h6>
		<p>In this honesty task, children were told they get 1 Starburst as a reward for completing the study. The experimenter handed them a gift box and asked them to make sure there was 1 Starburst in it. While the participant checked, the experimenter turned away and took notes. The experimenter recorded whether or not the child admitted that there was more than 1 Starburst, and if so, how many extra Starbursts were returned.</p><br>
		<div class="h-30"></div>
		<h6>Takeaways</h6>
		<p>Each iteration of pilot testing revealed a lot of information about the study design. We encountered problems we did not predict and modified our design accordingly. Here were some of our observations while testing each task:</p><br>
		<u>Forgiveness Task</u><br>
		<p>
			<ul style="list-style-type:square;">
				<li>This task generated variation in the ratio of drawings thrown away/drawings given back - 4/1, 3/2, 2/3, 1/4, 5/0, 0/5.</li>
				<li>Younger kids did not understand the comprehension question "where do you put the drawings?" We changed this to: "If you wanted to give a drawing to the other kid, where would you put it?” </li>
				<li>Some of the kids weren't paying attention to the note. The experimenters adapted in future trials by playing up the dramatic tone in their voices to keep kids engaged. </li>
				<li>When researchers asked "Was it ok?" they were referring to whether or not it was ok that another kid completed the drawings. However, some participants interpreted this question as "were the drawings pretty?"</li>
				<li>Some of the kids liked the completed scratch drawings so much that they forgot about the fact that the other kid was not supposed to complete them. Some even instantly forgave the other kid because of how pretty the drawings were. We changed the drawings so that they were less appealing in later trials.</li>
		</ul></p><br>
		<u>Honesty Task - Marbles</u><br>
		<p>
			<ul style="list-style-type:square;">
				<li>Every kid correctly guessed (without looking) that the all-yellow box was filled with all yellow marbles. One kid did look inside. </li>
				<li>In the privacy box, kids tended to pick more marbles than they were supposed to. Experimenters could not intervene because the premise of the task was that experimenters did not know what was going on behind the box.</li>
				<li>Many would pick out the marbles quickly and wouldn't wait for instructions. </li>
				<li>Many of them would show the experimenter the marble.</li>
				<li>No one lied.</li>
		</ul></p><br>
		<u>Honesty Task - Gift Box</u><br>
		<p>
			<ul style="list-style-type:square;">
				<li>This task was more effective than the marble task.</li>
				<li>This task generated variation.</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Multiple participants returned extra Starburst. </li>
					<li>Around half of participants lied.</li>
					<li>One participant was spontaneously honest about the fact that there was more than 1 Starburst, but didn't return any. </li>
				</ul>
				<li>To make sure the variation wasn’t due to disappointment of receiving no Starburst in the marble task, we counterbalanced the order of the honesty tasks. </li>
