             <p> I'm fascinated by emerging technologies and their impact on individual users as well as society at large. I graduated from Tufts University with a B.S. 
		    in Cognitive and Brain Sciences and minors in Computer Science and English. </p> <br>
              <p> My interdisciplinary background as well as my previous work in both academia and startup spaces inspired my interest in human-technology interaction. I
		am fascinated by the way that technology shapes human behavior and changes the way people interact with one another. I hope to continue my education and 
		learn how to create technology that is not only pleasant to interact with, but can spark lasting positive change – and do so with ethics and wellbeing in
                mind. I am hopeful for a future in which the "Screen Time" on our phones is a small number compared to "Outdoor Time" or "In Person Conversation Time." </p>

Boston’s cold this time of year<br>
but on my daily cement march<br>
the rain makes the blown up<br>
cancer cells shine. I know you’re tired<br>
of the under-salted food and<br>
the solitary walk from the library.<br>
I hope you know your existence<br>
is striking. Cry not on those wet strolls<br>
through the systematically bathed grass.<br>
Awash in the loss, you are still<br>
moving people with the brilliance<br>
of your seaweed eyes. You are moving me.<br>
You will learn how to run your hands,<br>
all their soft and calloused parts, <br>
through the thick of it.<br>
I feel this too, though it doesn’t make me sad.<br>
I have been swirling in this brackishness,<br>
salt crystals making my abdomen tingle<br>
with pleasure from time to time.<br>
But as the rainy season has come<br>
the salt has washed away.<br>
Not all of it, I’m sure. <br>
It goes something like this:<br>
relishing in songs of religion,<br>
though belonging to none;<br>
counting the people you’d call up for tea<br>
and reaching a meaningless sum;<br>
cars creating artificial wind<br>
blending with your lips holding<br>
onto the whisper<br>
“I am love. I am love.” in a low hum.</p><br>

When I was young, it was with my legs<br>
jumping on the wooden seesaw swing<br>
among the first streams of daytime light.<br>
Orienting my body in time to the pendulum,<br>
in rhythm with the lake waves floating timidly<br>
out of my periphery<br>
<br>
Later I learned to speak with my hands,<br>
like leaves falling slowly on concrete:<br>
I don’t know how to help but I am sorry,<br>
or like violin strings snapping and fanning out:<br>
I don’t know how to help and I am frustrated<br>
<br>
When I don’t want to be seen I speak with my eyes<br>
needing, wanting to leave<br>
trying to hug you with the inside of my body<br>
trying to summon your gaze with the yearning in mine<br>
<br>
Now with my mouth, each day coated in coffee<br>
I tell myself I no longer have the energy to be weary,<br>
or with my jaw jerking up and down slightly<br>
like it is being held by a dozing puppeteer<br>
I hush the urge inside me to mistakenly misspeak<br>
<br>
Though sometimes, like an unwatched pot overflowing,<br>
I pour the steam from my mouth<br>
only for the air to whip it back, a guilty wind,<br>
and I return to speaking the way I have always known:<br>
<br>
removing one by one each bodily messenger<br>
my arms, my legs, my eyebrows and lips<br>
slinking up the stairs like an out-of-sync army<br>
leaving a patch of absence to do my communicating </p><br>

Gentle traffic or a violent breeze:<br>
one of these is the low hum outside<br>
my window this morning.<br>
Saliva like honey,<br>
the leftover smoke<br>
from a chamomile candle,<br>
the distance between today’s me<br>
and yesterday’s –<br>
they prod me awake.<br>
Right now feels like sitting at the head<br>
of the table in my childhood<br>
home, when the sun shone through<br>
the glass of the kitchen window<br>
and was blinding.<br>
It punished me<br>
for my ambition.<br>
<br>
Puffs of caustic orange<br>
advance on the sky.<br>
I panic<br>
and for a second<br>
believe they are flames<br>
destroying a house quietly<br>
so as not to disturb<br>
anyone’s slumber.<br>
I spring up from my bed to find that<br>
the flame is just thick smoke<br>
churned from a chimney<br>
and transformed by the tint of sunrise.<br>
I can feel its pigment from inside,<br>
magnificent and sickening.<br>
I think about<br>
thinking about<br>
my first love in the holiday light-lit<br>
streets of Waikiki.<br>
So much of my thinking<br>
I have done removed.<br>
<br>
I no longer say <i>moozadell</i> like my mother.<br>
I say mozzarella.<br>
While we fought so much<br>
about my self-worth,<br>
my brothers had the opposite<br>
problem. The best swimmers always drown<br>
she’d tell them.<br>
Time whispers in my ear<br>
and says she will push the water of the minutes under me<br>
so that I drift forward before becoming<br>
fully aware of the waves<br>
and I will go home.<br>
On the orange bus ride back home<br>
maybe I will be keeping someone<br>
in my pocket.<br>
Keeping someone so close<br>
will help me stop wishing<br>
to keep someone.<br>
<br>
The golden smoke of haste<br>
continues its plummeting from<br>
the chimneys by my window<br>
and I toss quarter-shaped hope<br>
into the wishing fountain fumes.<br>
The vapor doesn’t look<br>
so much like flames<br>
anymore.<br>
<i>Cuando l’amico chiedo, non v’è domani</i> –
each day new smoke<br>
piles onto the old. You never live<br>
the same way twice.<br>
The sun will always grab the exhaust<br>
before it reaches the atmosphere.<br>
Minutes later,<br>
the light will be blinding.</p><br>

me  in  the bathroom mirror<br>
wobbly   kneed   and  warm<br>
clutching  at  this  unknown<br>
stone,  ripped  off  its  chain<br>
and last night passed  to  me<br>
across  the  dinner  table,  as<br>
casually as if it were the salt<br>

they say the lotus-eater<br>
becomes bound by<br>
blissful forgetfulness<br>
<br>
pink silk petals like napkins,<br>
delicious, juicy, peaceful<br>
sleep. pastel mindlessness.<br>
<br>
they say no one bets enough<br>
on the winning horse. luck<br>
sometimes visits the fool.<br>
<br>
waitress name tags like bricks<br>
of gold. dollar signs like argon<br>
flashing lights like a fruit dumpster<br>
<br>
the lotus-eater and gambler<br>
alike do not see the tourists<br>
or taxis. there are no windows<br>
<br>
no sunlight,<br>
no auto-timed night lights.<br>
time is measured<br>
<br>
in roulette wheel spins<br>
or not measured at all<br>
like a sloppy cosmopolitan<br>
<br>
minds drooping on a far-off wire,<br>
the gambler and lotus-eater<br>
do not know how quickly<br>

the horse crosses the finish,<br>
the machine swallows<br>
their money, or<br>
<br>
a metal boat tail of .45 inches<br>

they would not hear it anyway.<br>

<br>
dancing like firecrackers.<br>
still the fake Eiffel stands.<br>
still the lotuses are served.<br>

still the floors of Mandalay Bay are swept.<br>
still the waitresses flash their teeth.<br>
the flashing lights are not still.<br>
<br>
they say it’s terrorism.<br>
next week they say drinks<br>
fifty percent off for ladies.<br>
<br>
a shot for six dollars or three for eighteen.<br>
the math is the same but to the fool<br>
who wants his liquid luck, his courage<br>
<br>
and protection served<br>
in glass cups or in metal<br>
shells. still they come<br>
<br>
to eat lotus that is hidden in the chips<br>
and cards and designer handbag stores.<br>
still<br>
<br>
is how this place remains.<br>
among the dancing, spinning,<br>
flashing, running, screams<br>
<br>
and cheers and winnings.<br>
the shades of pink<br>
unchanged, concealing.<br>

I came into the world already nostalgic for it.<br>
Sturdy metal, slightly rugged and reminiscent<br>
of fishing on a storm-torn boat:<br>
this is the form, previously unquestioned, of the shrunken scallop scepter.<br>
<br>
I’ve noticed the salt and pepper speckles<br>
and the brininess of each formerly pristine crease.<br>
I’ve had this scepter for so long that it’s defining characteristic<br>
is belonging to me.<br>
<br>
I never considered the rich blue waves<br>
that bore it. I never thought of the people<br>
who’d had it before me; all the times it was shoved<br>
into bags or dropped on hardwood<br>
<br>
or held in a hard clench or in the bed of a tender palm,<br>
all the etchings traced by other fingers,<br>
all the shelves where it collected dust,<br>
all the windows it sat by and faded.<br>
<br>
Beneath the erosion are signs of the former state,<br>
like years of waves grabbing at the sand and digging up a shoreline.<br>
I entered as a point on its timeline, grabbed hold of the current<br>
and was pushed endlessly forward.<br>
<br>
It seems too late now to wonder.<br>
I cannot imagine that it may have been<br>
floating beneath another moonlight<br>
on water that is<br>
out of reach.<br>

I almost never wonder what you’re doing<br>
but then I saw this:<br>
a house on fire,<br>
with next door waiters<br>
bringing plates to tables,<br>
every other building as still<br>
as the one on fire, <br>
accepting its flames<br>

I listened to your radio show<br>

I found out you listened to mine too<br>

my backpack spilled out flowing like a coffee<br>

of them, blank valentines, my journal<br>

it’s basically a CVS<br>
remember that time I tripped outside CVS and my coat lost all the buttons?<br>

In an alternate universe <br>
we’re together at an event with table assignments<br>

There is a bike room in my apartment building<br>
that looks like claustrophobia<br>
and I used to write letters against the egg-white walls<br>
when I’d be on my way out and remember<br>
I had something to say,<br>
and down the hallway there’s a table with a jar of mints.<br>
I used to see how many I could eat at once without anyone noticing<br>
when my parents told me to come say goodbye to our guests<br>
but really they all stood in the hallway,<br>
straddling between a visit and an exit,<br>
and I never understood why they held onto <br>
coming-over-for-dinner<br>
so tightly.<br>
The mints taste like exhaustion so I don’t eat them anymore<br>
but sometimes I check the drawer beneath them<br>
and every once in a while there’s something new there.<br>
I have a pencil box in my room filled with things I’ve found –<br>
scrap leather, a pin, a receipt and a thimble – I don’t know<br>
who they belonged to and I don’t give it much thought <br>
but I like the way they all seem to make sense together.<br>
Past the hallway and out the door <br>
there are street lamps of red, yellow and white.<br>
For the past few years, I’ve almost<br>
never walked there without wearing headphones<br>
and three songs down the street<br>
is a bakery with the most mediocre cupcakes I’ve ever had<br>
but I sat there once with someone who I didn’t know<br>
would become my best friend<br>
and now whenever I taste chemical frosting<br>
I think about how our teeth stained blue<br>
as we desperately tried to fill the speechless spaces<br>
like stuffing socks into a drawer.<br>
If you walk down a little more<br>
there’s a tree that smells like dead fish for most of spring<br>
but there’s one day where it smells<br>
like rain and peaches<br>
and then the next day it dies.<br>
When I miss home I wish I had a bottle of that smell.<br>
Around the corner is the same barbershop<br>
I’ve gone to since I was a kid.<br>
My hair has been as long as <br>
down to my chin and as short as <br>
suitable for an office building<br>
and I’m not sure which I like better.<br>
Down the block there’s a bench made of wood<br>
with dark green paint on the armrests<br>
and I remember when it used to be shiny.<br>
Over the years it’s been my bench and our bench and the bench.<br>
And when I pass by, it sometimes feels like a shot<br>
you expected to hurt<br>
but when the needle goes in<br>
you don’t feel anything.</p><br>

I remember the winter we spent in Belleayre.<br>
Mornings were spent shivering on a mountain, hands curled<br>
up and red. Evenings were spent by coal fire,<br>
listening to bluegrass on the cd player. Morning snow<br>
dusted the bridge in the backyard. Our snow boots would reveal the wood<br>
and we’d follow it to get drinking water at the stream.<br>
<br>
Passing through the bow windows or the layers of steam from coffee, streams<br>
of January sunshine came to remind us we were in Belleayre.<br>
I wanted to bask in it but I would tap my fingers nervously on the wood<br>
counter, remembering the leaves that had shriveled and curled up.<br>
No matter how strong the beams, they did not turn the ice to snow.<br>
Shards of it in the wind still stung the face as hands hovered near the fire.<br>
<br>
This was the winter when I learned of the powerlessness of fire.<br>
As much as my skin warmed, like the deposit of a dried up stream,<br>
the cold put something deep inside me. The snow<br>
outside my steps now knows nothing of the snow in Belleayre.<br>
We stand outside my steps now, or lie on my bed, curled<br>
close enough to see your face’s creases, aging the same way as wood.<br>
<br>
I remember the winter and know that if I were cold you would<br>
tell me, the color of rosewood glistening in your eyes, to sit by the fire.<br>
I know this because I remember all the times I’d lay there, curled<br>
up in a flannel blanket, like a frog pulled out of a stream.<br>
Some nights I’d warm up enough to love Belleayre,<br>
and the postcard collection in the living room, and the carpet that matched the snow.<br>
<br>
Sometimes when I told you this you didn’t get it. You’d tell me there’s fresh snow<br>
and I knew for you that was explanation enough, and you would<br>
walk out to load the ski gear into the car. I think this is when I knew I didn’t love Belleayre<br>
but I loved the things that all happened to reside close together there, like kindling in a fire.<br>
On days when I wanted to stay in, take a walk to the stream,<br>
keep track of the warmth, I saw my desires break you. Your words curled<br>
<br>
as they hit the air. Sometimes when your hands and mine are curled<br>
I don’t squeeze so tight because I remember how your voice sounded. I looked out at the snow<br>
because it hurt to hear it. Sometimes now my words stream<br>
out because I don’t want to hear the water stop. Sometimes when I see wood<br>
I knock to check if it would make for a good fire.<br>
I feel one dwindling and I know part of it was lost in Belleayre.<br>
<br>
I never want to go back to Belleayre.<br>
I don’t want to watch the death of my fire.<br>
For now, I can scrape the pieces off of us to use as wood.
