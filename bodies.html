	        <p>This was a project for <i>Enigma</i>, an independent, student-run data journal at Tufts University. The purpose of this project was to learn about Tufts students’ perceptions regarding body and sex positivity and examine to what extent differences in perceptions exist between students of different genders. The goal was to promote greater awareness and understanding of the topic.</p><br>
	        <p>I designed a survey which had 202 respondents. Data was analyzed using Qualtrics.</p><br>

		<h6>Clothes</h6>
		<p>In our survey, we asked respondents to consider different factors in determining what clothes they choose to wear in different contexts. Specifically, we asked about the contexts of party/nightlife, class, dorm/hanging out, and work. Though we surveyed students about multiple factors, the one that produced significant data was the factor of sexual appeal.</p><br>
		<p>61% of women reported that they took sexual appeal into consideration when deciding what to wear to a party, compared to only 42% of  men.</p><br>
		<img src="img/proj-img/dress.png" width = "98%"><br>
		<p>This data may be affirmative of the societal pressures and high standards for women’s physical appearance that they so often report. Especially in contexts such as parties, women are socialized to associate beauty with sexuality; therefore, in order to appear beautiful and confident, many consider sexual appeal in their outfit choices. This does not mean that women are dressing for the male gaze; rather, this socialization is internalized. Many women feel more attractive and confident in sexually appealing outfits because they have been socialized to associate beauty with sexiness.</p><br>
		<p>Additionally, men appeared to be more aware of their sexual appeal in the workplace than women, with 13% of men reporting that they took this factor into consideration when dressing for work, while only 4% of women considered this. By dressing more conservatively and with less sexual appeal at the workplace, women may be attempting to mitigate the sexual harassment they receive (although no woman, despite their dress, can always be exempt from harassment). This is a consideration that is much less salient for men.</p><br>
		<div class="h-10"></div>
		<h6>Sex</h6>
		<p>It is a commonly held belief that men orgasm more frequently during sex than women. Our survey confirmed this belief among the Tufts students who responded. 91% of male respondents reported that they had an orgasm, about half the time, most of the time, or always when they had sex. However, only 41% of women reported the same.</p><br>
		<img src="img/proj-img/orgasm.png" width = "98%"><br>
		<p>This difference, however, is not due to inability to orgasm. 76% of women reported that they had an orgasm at least half the time during masturbation. In fact, at a 95% confidence interval, women were 20.4% to 48.5% more likely to orgasm at least half the time during masturbation than during sex with a partner. There was no such significant disparity for the male respondents.</p><br>
		<img src="img/proj-img/orgasm-masturbation.png" width = "98%"><br>
		<p>Furthermore, our survey found that men masturbated more frequently than women, with 92% reporting that they masturbated more than once a week, compared to only 39% of women.</p><br>
		<img src="img/proj-img/masturbation-gender.png" width = "98%"><br>
		<p>This, too, can be attributed to socialization that teaches female masturbation is taboo. From this survey, it is impossible to tell definitively whether these data are due to women’s under-reporting or due to a genuine lower frequency; however, the survey was completely anonymous, suggesting that the explanation may lean toward the latter.</p><br>
